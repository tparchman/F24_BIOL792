    "## Introduction to regular expressions\n",
    "We have already used some Unix (e.g., `grep`, `sed`, `tr`, `awk`) and Python (`str.count()`) tools that allow pattern recognition as a basis for completing some task or file manipulation. However, we were using these tools mostly to search for fixed patterns. While working with biological data, and really any other form of big data, we will encounter many problems that will require the ability to match flexible patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because pattern matching is a common task for working with big data, there is a standard set of tools in Python (and other languages) for dealing with them: regular expressions. Regular expressions are statements in code designed to match text with certain characteristics (ranging from exact matches to extremely fuzzy ones), are extremely useful in biology and across data science in general. This week we will start to learn about how to match specific and increasingly flexible patterns in data, as well as how to track, store, and manipulate the portions of strings that we wish to extract. Moving forward, you are likely to use regular expressions in many if not most of the code you write in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start working with regular expressions using the `re` module. As hinted previously with `sys`, libraries will play a major role in enabling your python code. We will cover that in more detail in a few weeks. For now, lets cover the basics of matching regular expressions with `re`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use functionality in the `re` library in your code, you will add a line near the top of your scripts that uses the `import` function. \n"
