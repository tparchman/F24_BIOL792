# Data Science for Biology I: Unix and Python



Fall 2024   
BIOL 792 - 1028   
**Prof**: Dr. Thomas Parchman; SFB 209; tparchman@unr.edu   
Class: Tuesday/Thursday 6:00 â€“ 7:10 pm FH 106  
Office Hours: By appointment    


## Course Description
Modern Biology is increasingly shaped by data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than most biologists are trained to work with. This is especially the case for the fields of genetics and genomics where major advances in DNA sequencing technology have cut the time and cost investment of DNA sequencing more than 100,000 fold. Spreadsheet software and graphical user interface statistical analysis packages (e.g., Excel, Statistica, JMP) are useless for this scale of data for any scientific discipline. This course will introduce students to basic computational tools (focusing on Unix and Python) to enhance data competency for modern biology. The course will involve hands on approaches and the manipulation and analysis of data collected for graduate student research projects as well as examples from genomic data sets generated in my lab. The course should provide a starting point for students to gain further expertise in simple programming and efficient manipulation and analysis of large-scale data. The tools to be learned in this class are not unique to genomics, and will be of value to research in any scientific field.  Prerequisites: must be enrolled as M.S. or Ph.D. student.


## Student Learning Outcomes
By the end of the semester, students should have learned enough to
start working more confidently with Unix and Python. We will emphasize tools often used in genomics and bioinformatics, but the applications learned will apply generally to data science. This course should also prepare students for the more advanced sister course, Data Science for Biology II, taught during spring semesters.

* Students will be able to operate in a Unix computing
     environment, and will understand the basic use of Unix computing
     clusters for research.
     
* Students will be able to write basic programs in Python in
       order to efficiently manipulate and work with large scale data.

* Students will be able to use basic Unix and Python to
       manipulate large genomic data sets, and to conduct basic analyses of
       genome level DNA sequencing data.

## Required Materials

* **Practical computing for biologists** Haddock, S.H.D. and Dunn, C.W., 2011. Sunderland, MA, USA: Sinauer Associates. The book provides an excellent guide to the much of content of the course, is filled with excellent examples and problems, and will also be utilized in Data Science for Biology II during spring semesters.

* **Computer with Unix/Linux operating system** Students with
  Mac computers already have machines running Unix and
  are ready to go. Same goes for students running Linux (Ubuntu, Centos, etc.). Students using computers running a windows OS or will need to figure out how to install Linux or a Linux emulator on their machine. 

* **Supplemental primers, readings and assignments** will be announced during the class and provided on the [course github page](https://github.com/tparchman/F23_BIOL792_coursepage).

## Course Format
We will meet twice a week (Tues/Thurs 6:00-7:15) but I typically reserve extra time during each window to allow discusion/troubleshooting on coding related to assignments and independent projects. At the beginning of each class, I will introduce new concepts and material that will form the basis of the exercises, assignments, or projects we will work through that week. We will cover questions regarding previous material, and then you will spend at least half of each class working independently, or in small groups, on writing code. All students should come to class having thoroughly read the assigned material and prepared to try new coding exercises. 

## Course Material Repositoy
All readings, primers, problem set instructions, datasets, as well as ample supplemental materials will be available on the [course github page](https://github.com/tparchman/F23_BIOL792_coursepage). This will include primers for Unix and Python content, and additional resources for learning more about Python, Unix, and genomic workflows, and information and data sets related to assignments. 

## Grades

Your grade in this course will be based on the following:

* **Weekly assignments (50%)** Assignments will involve working in the Unix environment, writing simple Bash and Python scripts, and working with a variety of large data sets that will be provided over the course of the semester. Assignments will be evaluated based on completion and effort. You can work in teams of 2 or 3 but will turn in your own Python.py or Bash.sh scripts for each assignment. Code should be annotated, step by step, to explain what you did to complete the task. More guidelines on these files and each specific assignment will be available on the course website. Assignments will be due before class on Tuesdays unless otherwise specified.
 
* **Participation (30%)** This is a graduate course, with full attendance and participation expected. Participation entails showing up for class prepared and doing your best to work through assigned tasks and programming example problems. Some of the material we cover might be easy and quick to figure out. Other material and tasks will present roadblocks that will be difficult to figure out. No questions will be stupid questions.
 
* **Independent project (20%)** Everyone will be responsible for an independent project which can be organized either individually, or as a group. This will involve identifying a task or problem in your research (or the research of the group you work within) that either requires, or can be made much more efficient, using Python or Unix scripting. Each group (or individual) will need to turn in a one to two page description of the task and how they will solve it by **week 5**. By week 12, each group will need to turn in final scripts and a one to three page description of how the problem was solved, and how the code works. In addition, each group will give a short (5-10 minute) presentation that describes the data, the problem, and how their scripting tools work. For those without data or ideas, I can supply some options.

**Grading scale as follows:**

| Percentage| Grade|
|---------|---|
| 90-100% | A | 
| 80-89%  | B |
| 70-79%  | C |
| 60-69%  | D |



## University Policies
### **Dropping/Withdrawing**
