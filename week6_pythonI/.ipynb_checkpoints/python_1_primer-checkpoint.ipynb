    "# 1. Installing/updating to python 3 current version\n",
    "As we did with Unix, we are going to start slow and basic, ramping up as the weeks go on. First we are going to make sure everyone has the most recent version of Python installed. While doing this, we are going to take a slight detour to learn how incredibly easy it can be to download and install packages for Unix commands or programs that are not installed in the base system. For this, we will demonstrate the use of `brew`, which is command line utility for locating, downloading, and installing Unix packages on Mac computers.\n",

    "If you have already installed Homebrew - you dont need to do this. Check if you have it:\n",

    "# 2. Writing your first python program\n",
    "\n",
    "As with shell scripts, the first line of python scripts should be the shebang followed by the location of python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/local/bin/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unsure where you installed python3, you can easily figure out where it is:\n",

    "    $ which python3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in Haddock and Dunn, pg 127, you can also use the below as your first line. This allows you to send script to `env` first, which should then locate python3, wherever it resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "\n",
    "Either of the above will do, and are important **IF** or when you wish to convert your scripts to executable. If you want to do this, change the file mode: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod u+x first_python.py\n",
    "\n",
    "And run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ./first_python.py\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your first simple program, using a `print` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending information from your python scripts to stdout is accomplished with the `print` statement. Our first script will simply illustrate how we print specified text, and will serve to convince you that this might not be as hard as you thought it was. Use `touch` to make a blank text file, but give it a `.py` extension as is customary for python scripts. This script needs only two simple parts. First, your customary first line that should go in all of your scripts, which should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n",
    "Or the path to the specific location where python lives:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #!/usr/local/bin/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the use of `comment` text, marked with `#`, lets add a comment that is for you to read, not python. \n",
    "\n",
    "    #this is a comment: testing my first program with a simple print statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the line above will not be part of the interpreted code. Instead, you can make use of `#` to leave annotations for yourself or others in your code to explain what you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets add a print statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print (\"Im ready to learn python, and this is my first step\")\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now run your program in two ways. Simply (which we strongly recommend for this class):\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3 first_script.py \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, change to executable, then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ chmod u+x first_script.py\n",
    "    $ ./first_script.py\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# `#`: comment character, annotating your code.\n",
    "Anytime you use `#`, the rest of the line will be 'commented out'. This means python won't interpret what you write, and that you can write notes or annotations on what your code is doing, to help yourself and others. Make heavy use of this, and when you go back to old or strange code, you will know why you did what you did. When others make good use of this, you can learn more about why/how they did what they did. Use `#` frequently, especially in the early phases of learning python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In example code below and in other primers, I have put comments to describe some code using `#`.\n",

    "\n",
    "# A few notes on using jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are writing code using Jupyter notebooks, obviously the use of comment lines is different. In this case, taking a little bit of extra time to make the markdown you write clear and well orgnaized could go a long way in helping you to annotate and organize your code, and to learn going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The code boxes in this jupyter notebook, and others provided on the github page are active. Thus, if you pull the entire github repo for the course, or if you just download a jupyter notebook (e.g., python_1_primer.ipynb), you can open the file with jupyter from the command line as illustrated below, or from within jupyter from the anaconda navigator suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a jupyter notebook (files should have extension `.ipynb`) from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ jupyter-notebook python_1_primer.ipynb \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The active code blocks mean that you can add to or alter any of the python in the notebook and run it on the fly. I think this is a great way to learn."
