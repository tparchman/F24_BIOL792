    "The purpose of this problem is for you to learn and practice how to assign keys and values to a dictionary, to use some dictionary functions to demonstrate that your dictionary is working, and to print out some useful information. We are first going to use the file SG_ref.fasta that is available on the course website. Read in the SG_ref.fasta file from `sys.argv[]` or `glob.glob` and try the following:\n",

Inside the same loop make a separate dictionary that has the fasta ids as keys and the sequence length as a value (remember that calculating the length of a scalar is easy). Now you should have two dictionaries, and you could do some things with either or both of them.\n",
